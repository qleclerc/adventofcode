## Solution



```{r solution1}

for(i in 0:9){
  
  mem_length_cups = length(cups)
  
  current_cup = i %% length(cups) + 1
  
  moved_cups = c(cups, cups)[(current_cup+1):(current_cup+3)]
  
  target_cup = cups[current_cup] - 1
  
  repeat{
    if(target_cup %in% moved_cups){
      target_cup = target_cup - 1
      next
    }
    if(target_cup < min(cups)){
      target_cup = max(cups)
      next
    }
    break
  }
  
  cups = cups[-which(cups %in% moved_cups)]
  
  cups = c(cups[1:which(cups == target_cup)], moved_cups, cups[(which(cups == target_cup)+1):length(cups)])
  cups = cups[1:mem_length_cups]
  print(cups)
}
